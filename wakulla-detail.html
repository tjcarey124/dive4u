         </br> 
         <br>
  It’s easy to hit a few springs in a day, as dives are relatively short, and many places have gear rentals available on-site. </br> 
  <br>Start early in the morning at Blue Grotto. With a 100-foot-deep traverse, this is the deepest cavern in the area that’s accessible to non-cave divers. Then cross the street to Devil’s Den. </br> 
  <br>This spring has partially flooded an underground cave, making it one of the most picturesque dive entries in the U.S.</br> 
  <br></br> 
  <br>
  
  <strong class="emhere">Ginnie Springs</strong></br> 
  <br>
  From there, it’s an hour’s drive to Ginnie Springs. </br> 
  <br>The Ginnie Ballroom is one of the few overhead environments that’s safe for Open Water divers, but make sure to check out the entrances to the Devil’s Spring System as well. </br> 
  <br>Afterward, stay the night in Lake City, about 30 minutes from Ginnie.

  When you hear the words “Prehistoric Sinkhole” the first thing that comes to mind probably isn’t that it would be a great place to dive. </br> 
  <br>But the spring-fed caverns near the city of Williston are routinely listed as some of the best places to dive in Florida. Devil’s Den, Blue Grotto, and Ginnie Springs all offer a relatively similar experience of diving in caverns filled with water from underground aquifers. </br> 
  <br>Typically these are very good places to explore if you are a new diver, or if you have an interest in another of Florida’s unique diving experiences. </br> 
  <br>Ginnie Springs also offers opportunities for real cave diving if you have the proper training.</br> 
  <br>
  
  1. Ancient limestone aquifers provide a truly spectacular diving experience</br> 
  <br>
  2. Great place to do some unique diving for beginners</br> 
  <br>
  3. Uncommonly clear water is accommodating for snorkelers
  </br> 
  <br>
  The springs near Williston offer a special glimpse into a prehistoric network of freshwater tunnels that run nearly the entire length of Florida. </br> 
  <br>If you’re a cave diver who wants to explore the networks, check out Ginnie Springs, if you’re a new diver and to approximate the cave experience, check out Devils Den. </br> 
  <br>If you’re claustrophobic and don’t like the idea of enclosed spaces, Blue Grotto is probably your best bet.</br>
