         <strong class="emhere">Overview</strong>
         </br> 
         <br>
  The Alabama Point Jetties are a shore dive and part of a group of dive sites in Perdido Bay, which includes bridge piers and sea walls.</br> 
         <br>The jetties are found both on the west side and the eastern, Florida side of the bay. </br> 
         <br>The jetties bottom out at a shallow 25 feet and are therefore suitable for novice divers. The bottom is a mix of rock and sand, and visibility can reach 25 feet, good enough to see the bottom from the surface.
  </br> 
         <br></br> 
         <br>
  <strong class="emhere">Perdido Pass</strong></br> 
         <br>
  Perdido Pass separates Alabama Point from Florida Point. </br> 
         <br>As Perdido River spills into the mouth of the bay it creates a passage connecting the Gulf of Mexico to the south and Perdido Bay to the north. Two barriers stretching into the gulf, created by rock, form the west and east jetties. </br> 
         <br>Rock, concrete, deployed materials, and sunken vessels create reefs that guard the entrance to the pass. </br> 
         <br>The water depths range anywhere from 5 to 8 feet deep but were recently dredged, dropping to 9 and 12 feet in some places. 
  </br> 
         <br></br> 
         <br>
  <strong class="emhere">Marine Life</strong></br> 
         <br>
  The marine life you may encounter at the Alabama Point Jetties include crabs, encrusted mollusks, Black Sea urchins, alewives, pinfish, an array of juvenile fish species, minnows, mullet, rainbow wrasse, banded butterflyfish, damselfish, belted sandfish, octopus, stingrays, horseshoe crabs, sea nettle jellyfish, and possibly sharks.
  </br> 
         <br>
  Though the Alabama Point Jetties can be an excellent place to snorkel and dive, it is also a popular spot for fishing as wellâ€” and an extremely busy and high-traffic area for boaters. </br> 
         <br>The seawall and jetty are found on the west side of Perdido Pass. </br> 
         <br>For the best conditions, diving during an incoming tide an hour or more before the peak is suggested. Winter may lessen the number of anglers.
