         <strong class="emhere">Overview</strong>
         </br> 
         <br>
  Lake Jocassee is a 7,565-acre man-made lake in the South Carolina mountains. </br> 
  <br>Formed by the Whitewater, Thompson, and Toxaway Rivers, it is known for its mostly undeveloped shoreline, views of the Jocassee Gorges Wildlife Management Area and surrounding mountains, and waterfalls that cascade directly into the lake.</br> 
  <br>
  Mountain streams and several waterfalls feed into the lake making it a cool place to spend a hot summer afternoon. And to show how unusually clear the water is, it is also known for its excellent SCUBA diving and swimming.
  </br> 
  <br>
  Lake Jocassee is one of South Carolina's best keep-diving secrets! </br> 
  <br>With an average of 20-30ft of visibility (sometimes up to 60ft) and many dive sites, this lake is a playground for divers. </br> 
  <br>There are wrecks, graveyards, houses, training platforms, a forest dive, and much more! Some of the dive sites can be accessed by walk-in!
  </br> 
  <br></br> 
  <br>
  <strong class="emhere">Location and History</strong></br> 
  <br>
  Lake Jocassee is a lake in Devil's Fork State Park in the Blue Ridge Mountains, in upstate South Carolina. </br> 
  <br>It is a manmade lake created by the building of a dam in 1973. Its clear mountain waters make it ideal for scuba diving. </br> 
  <br>The maximum depth is over 360 feet and visibility is usually between 20 and 50 feet. In the summer, water temperatures are between 73 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit, and between 44 and 56 degrees in the winter. </br> 
  <br>Not only are the waters clear, but Lake Jocassee has some surprising things hidden at the bottom.

  <strong class="emhere">Where to Stay</strong></br> 
  <br>
  <a href="https://southcarolinaparks.com/devils-fork/camping">Devil’s Fork State Park</a>
  </br> 
  <br>
  The only public access to the lake is by visiting Devil’s Fork State Park which resides on the southern end of Lake Jocassee. </br> 
  <br>Fortunately, Devil’s Fork State Park is a wonderful place to visit and camp. Offering a boat-in campground, 25 lakeside walk-in tent sites, or 59 standard campsites for RV/tent camping, you’ll find plenty of quiet, shaded sites and access to the water. </br> 
  <br>Remember to reserve in advance.
  </br> 
  <br>
  If you don’t want to camp, they also offer 20 lakeside villas with two and three-bedroom units.
  </br> 
  <br>
  The Main Campground</br> 
  <br>
  The main lakeside campground at Devils Fork State Park features 59 paved sites with water and electrical hook-ups, a picnic table, a tent pad, and a fire ring. </br> 
  <br>The sites are shaded and spacious but you will have no water view. </br> 
  <br>You’ll find several trails throughout the campground that lead to the shoreline though.
  </br> 
  <br>
  The bathhouse is clean and offers flush toilets and two hot-water showers (a nice bonus!) </br> 
  <br>And for convenience, you can purchase firewood, ice, and some basic provisions at the Visitor Center where you check in upon arrival.
