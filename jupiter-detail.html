       <strong class="emhere">Overview</strong>
       </br> 
       <br>
    Wake up and drive two and a half hours down the coast to Jupiter for a dive with Scuba Works. </br> 
       <br>Most popular reefs, like Tunnels, Scarface and Capt. Kirle’s, are deeper than 60 feet, but there are shallower trips for less-advanced divers, too. </br> 
       <br>Either way, you’ll have the chance to get up close and personal with goliath grouper, sea turtles, tigers, hammerheads, and lemon sharks.
    </br> 
       <br>
  After your charter, grab a bite to eat at the dockside bar and grill. Then, depending on the tides, gear up for a self-guided night dive at Blue Heron Bridge, where you can see rays, octopuses, seahorses, and more.
      </br>

       <br><strong class="emhere">Marine Life</strong> 
      </br>
      <br>
The waters of Jupiter, Florida offer some of the most diverse marine life in the world.  </br> 
       <br>From our Turtle Mating Season in the Spring, Goliath Grouper Aggregation during late Summer, and Lemon Shark Migration in the Winter, Jupiter scuba diving boasts large aquatic life encounters year-round! </br> 
       <br>We also have the smallest most colorful creatures to satisfy the macro enthusiast! If that wasn’t enough, don’t forget Manta Rays, Green Moray Eels, Southern Sting Rays, Caribbean Reef Sharks, Nurse Sharks, Hammerheads, Mola Mola, and the occasional Whale Shark…
      </br> 
<br></br> 
<br><strong class="emhere">Equipment You Need to Bring</strong>
</br> 
<br>
Once you’ve been diving for a bit, it’s normal to start adding to your dive kit. 
</br> 
<br>With the exception of high-ticket items like cameras and scooters, nearly every bit of equipment a diver carries has the ability to increase a diver’s safety. 
</br> 
<br>So what should you consider? Jupiter Dive Center can help.</br> 
<br></br> 
<br><strong class="emhere">Dive Lights</strong></br> 
<br>
Dive lights are a great place to start. Day or night, dive lights do far more than bring out the muted colors of a deep dive. </br> 
<br>Lights make great signaling devices both under and above water. </br> 
<br>Need to get your buddy’s attention? A dive light can act as an impromptu tank banger.  </br> 
<br>Wreck and night divers need two lights—a primary and secondary light in the event the primary fails (and be honest, when was the last time you charged or changed your batteries?)</br> 
<br>You can’t go wrong with a Scubapro flashlight, and here are a couple of our favorites:</br> 
<br></br> 
<br><strong class="emhere">Dive Knife</strong></br> 
<br>
Another accessory to consider is a dive knife. </br> 
<br>Knives are utility tools that make short work of entanglements such as fishing lines, nets, or even kelp if you dive off the Pacific coast. Bear in mind that a good knife is an investment. Seawater corrodes metals, so make sure the knife you want is forged from marine-grade stainless steel or hardened titanium. </br> 
<br>Another thing to keep in mind is the difference in the blade tip—a pointed tip is great for working into a small or tight tangled line, while an angled Tanto tip is better for prying (this blunter tip looks similar to a chisel point). </br> 
<br>How you wear the knife may also factor into your decision. Larger knives tend to be worn on the leg, while smaller ones can be easily attached to your BCD.</br> 
<br>Again, we turn to Scubapro for some of our favorites.
</br> 
<br></br> 
<br>
<strong class="emhere">Noise Maker</strong></br> 
<br>
The final accessory in this blog post is the noise maker. In an ideal world, your dive buddies will always know exactly when you want to show them something or need assistance. But the safe diver knows that sometimes buddies are focused on something else. Enter the signaling device that uses noise. A tank banger can be almost anything hard that creates noise when banged against your tank.</br> 
<br>

And while flashlights work in a pinch, many divers would rather use something made for the occasion. The most common tank banger is a hard plastic ball strung like a bead on an elastic band that is stretched over your scuba tank.</br> 
<br>

Some instructors use a shaker or rattle. The name describes this handheld device perfectly. Still, others use an underwater air horn—great for an emergency recall, but not something you want to use to point out a fish on a crowded reef.</br> 
<br>

Remember sound travels four times faster underwater, so when you use a noisemaker, you may be signaling more divers than just your buddy.  Be considerate, but in an emergency, a noisemaker can be exactly the tool you need.</br>
